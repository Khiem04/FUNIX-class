</div>

<div>
    <p style = "line-height: 2">This Adidas shoes was introduced in 2019 by NBA star Damian Lillard, who currently play for the Portland Trail Blazers in 2019. This shoes generation has introduced the Lightstrike technology, which makes the shoes become more responsive and lighter. Let's go into detail to see what's special about this shoes. </p>   
</div>

<div>
    <h3>1. TRACTION</h3>
</div>

<div>
    <p style ="line-height: 2">Using basic herringbone traction from heel-to-toe, which also have been used in previous Dame shoes. For my personal belief, this traction is super grippy and have a loud squeaky sound when using on a very clean court. However, when I use it on outdoor court, the traction pick up dust very quickly, so prepared to wipe out a lot or stay away from dusty court. The poor rubber compound has killed its own traction pattern. So I recommend using this shoes on a super clean courts.  </p>

    <h3>2. CUSHION</h3>

<div>
    <p style = "line-height: 2">Lightstrike was used for the first time in Dame's shoes, and I don't hate it.Transition was smooth as butter and impact protection was very nice overall. Court feel wasn’t lost and I never felt slow or laggy due to sinking into the footbed. Although I prefer Bounce to Lightstrike, Lightstrike has done a great job on this shoes especially for a shoe that was designed for guard style play, this was just right.  </p>

    <h3>3. MATERIALS</h3>
</div>

<div>
    <p style="line-height: 2">Materials featured on the adidas Dame 6 are primarily textiles. They feel and play cheap.

        It was something that was a minor concern in my initial first impressions, but I was hopeful that they’d play just fine. I wouldn’t say the materials killed the performance or playability of the shoe at all, but the durability definitely took a hit.
        
        My left shoe’s outsole is peeling away from the upper. Either the glue job was poor to begin with or the type of glue used isn’t strong enough to bond to textiles properly. I find the latter option to be a bit far fetched as adidas is no stranger to gluing outsole and midsole tooling to textile builds. But, for whatever reason, the shoe looks like it was run over.</p>

    <h3>4. Support</h3>

<div>
    <p style="line-height: 2">It would have been better had the materials not buckled under certain movements and my heel been properly locked in. The wide base is nice and saved my ass when making lateral cuts and changes in direction without feeling cumbersome underfoot.

        However, having a solid wide platform is only a piece of the puzzle when it comes to support. The shoe should have a little of everything — and each of those things should work in unison with one another. </p>
