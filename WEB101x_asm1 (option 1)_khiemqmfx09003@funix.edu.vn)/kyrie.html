</div>

<div>
    <p style = "line-height: 2">The Nike Kyrie series is prominent for its flamboyant iterations and eye-catching collaborations. The pre-heat pack of the newest Kyrie pair was loaded with inspirations coming from Uncle Drew’s colorful basketball career.

        The four pairs included in the collection are just the intermission for upcoming colorways. Just like its predecessors, sneaker fans are expecting another batch of dope collaborations and drooling colorways from Irving’s newest signature shoe. </p>

<div>
    <p style ="line-height: 2">The Kyrie 7’s traction is infused with a data-driven pattern. Nike is committed to provide excellent traction for shifty players like Uncle Drew. The traction pattern is designed for better grip, whether you are making sudden shifts or sudden stops. The outsoles’ built is engineered to be used dominantly in clean indoor courts rather than in blacktops.  </p>

<div>
    <p style = "line-height: 2">Just like its past two predecessors, the Nike Kyrie 7 is infused with Zoom Turbo cushion, which covers the whole forefoot along with phylon materials in the midsoles. It is then built with a responsive foam along the midsole areas without compromising the court feel, which is highly-preferred by a lot of players.

        The Nike Kyrie 7 is lighter than the and much closer to the in terms of overall performance. While the pair offers a low, great court feel, some break-ins must be done to achieve the certain level of comfort the players prefer.  </p>

    <h3>3. MATERIALS</h3>
</div>

<div>
    <p style="line-height: 2">The Nike Kyrie 7 comes in raw, mesh textiles upper for ventilation and support. The uppers ensure that the whole pair is lightweight, maybe the lightest among the Kyrie series. The heel portion is infused with leather materials that serve as heel counter and additional aesthetics.

        While the upper materials provide topnotch overall performance and excellent aesthetics, Nike could have infused more premium and innovative materials given that the Nike Kyrie series is becoming one of the most prominent and best-performing signature line available.</p>

    <p style="line-height: 2">The Nike Kyrie 7 is lighter than the and much closer to the in terms of overall performance. While the pair offers a low, great court feel, some break-ins must be done to achieve the certain level of comfort the players prefer.

        The pair will also boast four flaps made in TPU in the forefoot area. These flaps reinforce the lacing system of the pair for better tightness and hug. Players will just hope that these flaps are durable enough since it will ruin the pair’s tightness and aesthetics if they will be easily detached from the pair. </p>
