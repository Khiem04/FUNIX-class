</div>

<div>
    <p style = "line-height: 2">18 years of performance basketball shoes built for the most explosive basketball player ever (EVER!!!). LeBron James’ Nike line is typically the flagship for Nike basketball technologies and the Nike LeBron 18 carries on the tradition.

        The shoe already has a place in history. LeBron won his fourth title overall and first with the Los Angeles Lakers while wearing them in 2020’s NBA Bubble. But despite the hype, the question remains, is the LeBron 18 a great performing basketball shoe? Let’s find out. </p>

<div>
    <h3>1. TRACTION</h3>
</div>

<div>
    <p style ="line-height: 2">The traction was very consistent during my time in the Nike LeBron 18. Indoors, it worked wonders. I love the flex grooves as it allowed the rubber to remain in contact with the floor at all times. 

        Outdoors, they’ve held their own as well. Not extremely durable, but effective nonetheless.  </p>

    <h3>2. CUSHION</h3>
</div>

<div>
    <p style = "line-height: 2">Three layers of cushioning makes the Nike LeBron 18 one of the most cushioned shoes of 2020. 

        A Cushlon midsole surrounds a rear Air Max unit and a full length Zoom Strobel. Sometimes having this much cushion could end up being too soft which can create some lag time with your movements. However, the mix of cushioning systems worked well without much delay. 
        
        While they were comfortable indoors, outdoors is where the cushion shines. Impact protection is on another level. If you’re a player that wants to have as much cushion as possible then this is currently your best bet. </p>

    <h3>3. MATERIALS</h3>
</div>

<div>
    <p style="line-height: 2">The tongue in my Lakers colorway is synthetic suede. While it didn’t chafe as bad as those with the Reflections colorway, it still bugs. The built in air bubbles make the tongue flex weird and it doesn’t really settle down until you lace all the way up. Luckily, the gusseted tongue doesn’t slide side to side. The LeBron 18 is begging for a LeBron 10 style tongue that would better match the nylon heel material.</p>

    <h3>4. Support</h3>
</div>

<div>
    <p style="line-height: 2">Heel support and containment are awesome. The forefoot, as stated in the fit section, could be tweaked. Sitting within the midsole will help a lot with ensuring you remain on the footbed while making lateral movements. An outrigger will also help avoid the roll over that you can experience as well. </p>
