    <article> Hello, everyone. I'm Khiem, founder of this website. I'm sure for baller or hooper, we usually own or wear basketball shoes, but how to choose it for its needs and the courts that we are using is a problem for some of the players. This website will do some review based on some of the newest basketball shoes, and I will do a rating system based on 4 things: Traction, Cushion, Material and Support. Hope you enjoy this reviewðŸ˜Š  </p>
