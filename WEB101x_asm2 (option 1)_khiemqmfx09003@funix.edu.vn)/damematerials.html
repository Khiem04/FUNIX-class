    <p style="line-height: 2">Materials featured on the adidas Dame 6 are primarily textiles. They feel and play cheap. It was something that was a minor concern in my initial first impressions, but I was hopeful that they’d play just fine. I wouldn’t say the materials killed
        the performance or playability of the shoe at all, but the durability definitely took a hit. My left shoe’s outsole is peeling away from the upper. Either the glue job was poor to begin with or the type of glue used isn’t strong enough to bond
        to textiles properly. I find the latter option to be a bit far fetched as adidas is no stranger to gluing outsole and midsole tooling to textile builds. But, for whatever reason, the shoe looks like it was run over.</p>
